How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  I would choose an environment that best supports the best security practices. I would also look to automate the processes in order to correct the coding flaws in a steady environment instead of only looking for errors once the application is complete.
  
How do I interpret user Needs and incorporate them into a program?
  I would look at the functions that are needed by the end user, and then look at how to implement those functions. Accessibility is also a very important factor. These days, everyone needs everything no matter where they are in the world. 
  
How do I approach designing Software?
  I would approach designing software by first eastablishing what is needed. What all is the end user needing for this applciation? Approximately how much data is going to be stored? How big of servers or storage will be needed to run this? The list goes on.
